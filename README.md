# ros2-gazebo-dev-plugin

A ROS2 Foxy Gazebo plugin that drives controls a specified joint to simulate
a motor.  The simulation of the motor is simple as only the rotational
velocity or the position can be set using the ROS message.

Setup and basic test instructions are in this
[read me file](docker/README.md).

Notes on how I developed the plugin can be found in my
[development notes](development_notes.md).

I hope you find it useful!
